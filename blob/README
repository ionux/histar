- libhtc_ril.so was modified from the original to ignore the NEEDED .so
  dependencies that we don't have (by changing the symbols to all be
  libm.so). We then put the necessary symbols in pkg/rild/android_*.c.

- libhtc_ril.so was also modified to call Xthread_ rather than pthread_
  functions, since HiStar's pthread.c isn't binary compatible.
  android_pthread.c provides the necessary translation stubs.

- libgps.so was modified in a way similar to libhtc_ril.so, but it's worse
  than initially expected -- the library is prelinked and cannot simply be
  dlopened. To work around this, we must handle a few things:

	- The prelink was at 0xa9700000 (as can be seen in the PRE tag
	  in the last 8 bytes of the file). This has two issues: first,
	  we don't handle any prelinking, let alone Android's method.
	  Second, our user/kernel split is at 0x80000000, nearly a full
	  gigabyte lower. My solution was to change all absolute addresses
	  I could find in the file to 0x68000000 and hack ldso to mmap the
	  library in the right place.

	- RELCOUNT is stuck at 193, but there are no relative relocs to
	  be done after Android's 'apriori' got done with it, so it must
	  be zeroed (offset 0x13110), else ldso screws up.
