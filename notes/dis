client talking to server:
  server must be "stronger" in each category where the label of client's
  data is greater than 1 (must "speak for" every such category).

server accepting client input:
  client must be "stronger" in each category where the label of client's
  data is less than 1.  quite symmetric to the above condition, and the
  {1} is then just the network label which we can then in theory adjust.

how do we know we can talk to server?
  server must sign certificate saying "you can reach me at this address
  for this period of time".  then, must also have a chain of certificates:
  server -> ... -> category, for each over-1 cat..

  name servers by their public keys.

  lots of public information can be broadcast to avoid fetching on
  demand & covert channels:
   * servers can broadcast their addressing certificates.
   * various group certificates can be broadcast as well.

support rpc & streams ala network-objects?
 - RPC (effectively remote gate invocation, with segments for in/out data),
 - streams (for more efficient IPC without gate crossings -- potentially
   will be doing RPC over the stream anyway, but no gate calls in fastpath)

granting categories, verify labels should work across remote gate calls

httpd front-end would grant per-session category to import daemon and
give it a delegation saying all back-ends speak for this category, i.e.
allowing the tainted worker to interact with the back-ends..

default clearance on the network is 1, and not 2.  gates for importer
and exporter daemons should similarly have a default clearance of 1 to
keep things simple.

privilege-granting gates: exporter/importer daemons may want to stash
away star privileges in a gate, ala lib/privstore.cc.  we can optimize
the two gate calls down to 1 by simply longjmp'ing back to where we 
were before the first gate call, and returning from there, with a new
label -- we're still in the same address space..

how do we know the label of the response?  gate mechanism doesn't tell
us the prior label of the thread..  A: force return gate to marshall
return data into an explicit segment, whose label is then immutable
and must have been readable to the returning thread before the gate
call.  must use verify label to ensure that the caller's label was
enough to read/write this segment, otherwise could be trying to send
out a pre-existing read-only segment.

can server send response back to client?  need to check whether client
owns every category in which the response is tainted.  similar to the
first condition at the top of this file, and potentially client should
provide server with the necessary delegation certificates to make things
work out..  similarly, client should check data received from server.

what does the back-end fileserver look like?  what does it associate
the local categories with, if anything?  maybe it doesn't need to do
any discretionary access control based on them, in which case it's all
good.  otherwise, it needs access to global category names to coordinate
with other fileservers too..

can use TCPA-like stuff to trust histar without trusting node owners
(probably just a mention in the paper)

category garbage-collecton?  even if it's explicitly by category owner,
the owner doesn't necessarily know what nodes its untrusted code has
talked to...

our RPC library should support pre-specified timeouts for gate calls
and/or explicit call cancellaton which would unlink the container to
ensure all tainted data is deleted from the remote end.

front-end histar proxy to a linux box which labels any data handled
by linux.  similar to what we could do with sane port labeling.

===

timestamps (valid-after and valid-before) on each delegation; export
server should revoke all tainted gate call containers when delegations
leading to a particular category expire (and no newer delegations are
available).

when granting categories across gate calls, automatically create a
matching global category if none already exists, and automatically
create delegations if the target exporter/importer doesn't have the
category delegated to it.

label rules:

Node_L(c) = { *, if Node speaks for c (i.e., Node -> ... -> c); 0 otherwise }
N_L = network label ({1} as an example)
N_C = network clearance ({1} for internet, {2} for internal trusted network)

Message M with label M_L being sent to a receiver node R.  The sender should
check that (R_net_addr -> R), i.e. that we have the right network address
certificate, and that:

    M_L \leq (R_L^\histar \cup N_C)

When a receiver node receives a message M with label M_L from a sender node S,
it needs to check that:

    (S_L^\histar \cup N_L^\histar)^\star \leq M_L \leq (S_L^\histar \cup N_C)

===

if on the exporter side, a gate call reply comes in that's tainted such that
we cannot send the reply to the original caller, we need to pretend like the
gate reply never happened, i.e. CALL_INPROGRESS.

is it safe to tell the importer-side gate caller that a delegation is missing
for some of their categories, for the node they are contacting?  what if the
network label is { x3, 1 } and a caller with label { 1 } tries to call some
node with an unknown pk?  cannot tell him whether we have seen this node's PK
on the network broadcast or not!

charging declassifier; declassify only one taint category, and refuse multiple
taints.  e.g. monster.com, charges per record, but custom matching code..

use dj to interface HiStar with non-HiStar (call them Linux) nodes.
1) Linux machine can use a HiStar box to run untrusted code in a
   strictly-controlled environment
2) HiStar boxes can use a trusted Linux machine to store or process data.
   e.g. trusted database, file server, whatever non-portable code.
3) using a "gatekeeper" HiStar machine, can label an entire Linux machine.
   e.g. can now keep sensitive data on a Linux machine, and HiStar ensures
   that this data will not be leaked, and unauthorized users cannot even
   send any inputs to this sensitive Linux machine.  Can give linux machine
   stars in some categories but taint in others (ala clamwrap).

Gates conflate clearance with a "verify guard" label.  In particular, consider
signal gates which have a clearance of { ug 0 } to ensure that only the same
user can invoke them.  This could be done at user-level by checking the verify
label in gate entry code.  But this seems simple enough to push into the kernel
for better security.  Now, this has nothing to do with clearance.  Infact it
should be perfectly legal to invoke a gate whose clearance is below your own;
you can "grant" your high clearance to the gate, because clearance is combined
using \cup rather than \cap.  Nothing should leak as a result, either, because
you'll have to provide all resources for this "clearance-boosted" gate call.
So, maybe we should have a third "guard" label on gates that's separate from
clearance.  This will allow a gate creator to say that he's happy to accept
calls from threads more tainted than his current clearance, as long as those
threads are going to provide the resources for it.

Target-less gates (maybe address-space-less or even current-address-space) so
that privstore will work efficiently in a COWed address space.  Specify a null
thread_entry to sys_gate_create() to make such a gate, and add a thread_entry
arg to sys_gate_enter() that will allow caller to use such a gate.
