client talking to server:
  server must be "stronger" in each category where the label of client's
  data is not 1 (must "speak for" every such category)

how do we know we can talk to server?
  server must sign certificate saying "you can reach me at this address
  for this period of time".  then, must also have a chain of certificates:
  server -> ... -> category, for each non-1 cat..

  name servers by their public keys.

  lots of public information can be broadcast to avoid fetching on
  demand & covert channels:
   * servers can broadcast their addressing certificates.
   * various group certificates can be broadcast as well.

support rpc & streams ala network-objects?
 - RPC (effectively remote gate invocation, with segments for in/out data),
 - streams (for more efficient IPC without gate crossings -- potentially
   will be doing RPC over the stream anyway, but no gate calls in fastpath)

granting categories, verify labels should work across remote gate calls

httpd front-end would grant per-session category to import daemon and
give it a delegation saying all back-ends speak for this category, i.e.
allowing the tainted worker to interact with the back-ends..

default clearance on the network is 1, and not 2.  gates for importer
and exporter daemons should similarly have a default clearance of 1 to
keep things simple.

privilege-granting gates: exporter/importer daemons may want to stash
away star privileges in a gate, ala lib/privstore.cc.  we can optimize
the two gate calls down to 1 by simply longjmp'ing back to where we 
were before the first gate call, and returning from there, with a new
label -- we're still in the same address space..
