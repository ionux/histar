*** Be sure that `-mcpu' (in conf/Makefrag.arm) is properly set, otherwise weird
    things can happen. E.g. your pc magically gets OR'd with 0x80000000. ****

- arm procedure call convention requires sp to be 8-byte aligned

- r0-r3 are arguments / return values / scratch registers, the rest are usually
  callee-saved, or special in some way (sp, lr, pc)

- there's no clear way of storing the utrap mask in cpu state. there are lots
  of reserved bits floating around, but usually they're supposed to be 0. the
  alternative taken is to have a syscall that queries and another that modifies
  the mask on a thread's behalf. if this is too slow, we can try compiling the
  user-level code to reserve a register and check/modify the trapframe in the
  kernel.

- coreutils won't build if uclibc has __USE_EXTERN_INLINES defined (default),
  so def __NO_INLINE__ or snuff it out in include/features.h
