=== secrecy / privacy ===

* lots of different security compartments; either many different
  users or different parts of a user's data (finance, class, ..)

* preclude data from leaking outside, or at least not without
  being sanitized in some way

potential things to think about:

+ google search history
  - lots of users' data on the same server
  - what operations do users want from it?  what's the declassifier?
  - what does google want to do with the data?

+ crypto as declassifier
  - small piece of code that keeps your crypto key
  - taints when decrypted, declassifies when encrypted

=== integrity ===

...

spyware?
untrusted code that shouldn't be able to modify e.g. financial data?
