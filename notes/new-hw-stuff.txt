+ 32-entry, 2-way set assoc perm cache, low 4 bits are hash
+ to flush, write 2 diff values for each hash value

+ new trap value
+ instruction to load base address for tag array, 5-bit register addr is 10000b
+ all-ones in a table entry indicates fine-grained tags
+ need to do sta_mmuflush() after writing to the page tag table

+ MMU gets disabled on tag exceptions
+ MMU disable gets toggled high on crossing %rma, gets cleared on a tret

invariant: tag perms for DTAG_KRW, DTAG_STACK, etc are always in the cache
to ensure that we never preempt trap handling code, etc
