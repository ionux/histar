What should happen on trap to monitor mode?
    Disable traps [done in hw]
    Disable MMU [not done in hw yet]

We need to be careful with MMU state when doing protected calls.
    Put the MMU into a well-known state before switching PC tags

Control who can invoke what protection domains, and with what tags
    Global authorized dispatch table?

What should be the rules for combining privileges on protected calls?
    Might need to merge privileges of caller & callee
    Can emulate any behavior we want in software..

		Set T	Set S
Tag exception	YES	YES
Other exception	NO	YES

=> Need to preload access bits for kernel text, kernel stack,
   because we cannot handle tag exceptions in kernel window
   exception handling code.
