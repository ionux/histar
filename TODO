syscalls for specifying labels

object persistence
will probably need an iovec interface to disk_io()

what to do about return gates?

factor out elf-loader and spawn from the shell

change from pagemaps to segment-maps

possibly a cleanup stack?

===

labels for address spaces?
    we can stick a label in (struct Page)

what happens to pages mapped RW (or for that matter any pages) when th_label changes?
    make any th_label changes happen by jumping through a gate?
