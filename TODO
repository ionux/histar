segment copying with re-labeling
container labeling
verify/cleanup label checking
it would be great to factor label checks into kobject_get()
larger labels

what to do about return gates?

read/write flag to kobject_get()
copy-on-write kobjects
kobject pinning
snapshotting pstate_sync()
swapped-out zero-ref objects are never GC'ed

deal with segment fragmentation on-disk

what happens when we suspend cur_thread via thread_pagefault()
when we really incurred the fault in kernel-mode through a
syscall pointer argument?
