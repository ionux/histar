user-specified segment labeling
in-kernel segment copying
user-specified container labeling
larger labels

type-check for correct info_flow_type values (easier in C++)

* it would be nice if gate_enter() didn't automatically compute the
  contamination, but allowed the user to compute the target label
  and verified that it's OK.  benefit: easier to make return gate.
  is it OK to allow user to look at the gate's target label?

copy-on-write kobjects
kobject pinning
snapshotting pstate_sync()
swapped-out zero-ref objects are never GC'ed

deal with segment fragmentation on-disk

what happens when we suspend cur_thread via thread_pagefault()
when we really incurred the fault in kernel-mode through a
syscall pointer argument?
