* Add previous node pointers to leafs for range searches.  The current setup
  for "less than equal to" range searches can cause extra node reads.

* btree_insert.c btree_delete.c contain lots of superfluous code that was
  the result of seperating leaf and internal operations.
  
* inline btree_val* and btree_key* functions.

* for value sizes > 1, space from the key array should be given to the children
  array to support a larger order in leafs...right now space is wasted...need to
  change btree_init(), btree_node_order(), and setup of pointers in btree_impl.c
