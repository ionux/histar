# To generate a different set of embedded binaries, it's probably
# easiest to copy default.mk into local.mk and make any changes
# there, also changing the line below to include local.mk instead.
# This will avoid any merge conflicts when default.mk is updated.
#
# To add custom entries to inittab, use inittab.local or append
# to INITTAB_ENTRIES in the local.mk file.
